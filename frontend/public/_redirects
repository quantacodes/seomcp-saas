# Cloudflare Pages redirect rules
# Static HTML for legal pages (crawler-accessible)
# Everything else goes to React SPA

# Legal pages are static HTML (served as-is by Cloudflare)
# /terms.html, /privacy.html, /refund.html - no redirect needed

# Everything else (including /dashboard) goes to React SPA
